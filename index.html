    <h5> " In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few
Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you
'Cause I finally found, I finally found you
You never have to worry if what I say is true
Girl, I've been looking for you
And when I saw you I knew, that I finally found,
I finally found you" "~ Finally Found You, Enrique Iglesias"</h5>

Some how through the years of us being friends we ended up always passing by or somehow crossing paths. Destiny decided that we should always stay connected. In the year 2013, my senior year of high school I made the best decision of asking you to be my girlfriend! Life since then has been pure happiness. As we build our future and tighten our relationship together I decided to make this page for you to show off what I am capable of doing wityh my skills. </p>
